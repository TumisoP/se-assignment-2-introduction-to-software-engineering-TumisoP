Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users (Michigan Technological University, 2024)

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Programming is centered around the code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development (Medium, 2023). The full SDLC has 7 basic stages: Planning, requirements, design and prototype, software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In some cases, depending on different variables (project, team, manager, etc.), certain steps can be omitted, split, or combined (DistantJob, 2023)

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

The SDLC usually takes the form of one of 5 different methodologies and follows 7 main development stages: 1. Planning & Analysis: project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders, 2. Define Requirements: converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team, 3. Design: The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) and phase will include developing a prototype model, 4. Development: phase where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product, 5. Testing: quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do, 6. Deployment: phase where your final product is delivered to your intended user, and 7. Maintenance: phase is the final stage of the SDLC if you’re following the waterfall structure of the software development process where users may find bugs and errors that were missed in the earlier testing phase. These bugs need to be fixed for better user experience and retention (The Product Manager,2024)

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

The main difference is that Waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before moving on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project. Agile is preferred for team initiative and short-term deadlines. Waterfall is preferred for ideal for projects where the end result is clearly established from the beginning of the project (Forbs Advisor, 2024)

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

The Requirement Engineering (RE) is the most important phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This phase is used to translate the imprecise, incomplete needs and wishes of the potential users of software into complete, precise and formal specifications. Specifications act as the contract between the software users and the developers. Therefore the importance of Requirement Engineering is enormous to develop effective software and in reducing software errors at the early stage of the development of software (TechRepublic, 2024)

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity is a fundamental design principle in software engineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system. This helps to localize the impact of changes, simplifies maintenance, and enhances the understandability of the system (ITU Online, 2024)

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

1. Unit testing is also the first level of functional testing. The primary goal of unit testing is to validate the performance of unit components 2. Integration testing means combining different software modules and phases and testing as a group to ensure that the integrated system is ready for system testing or not, and there are many ways to test how different components of the system function at their interface 3. System testing allows checking the system’s compliance as per the requirements and all the components of the software are tested as a whole to ensure that the overall product meets the specified requirements. It involves load, reliability, performance, and security testing 4. Acceptance testing aims to evaluate whether the system complies with the end-user requirements and if it is ready for deployment. All the levels of testing are compulsory and have to be finished before the application/software is launched. By adopting a constant vigilance and checking viewpoint in all your projects, as well as by a systemized approach to testing, the tester can detect any defects in the system as soon as possible, which is a waste of time and money later (QACraft, 2024) 

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. Efficient branching and merging capabilities allow developers to work concurrently on various aspects of a project without interference, significantly reducing the time from development to deployment (GitLab, 2024)

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A project manager in software is responsible for leading a team of software developers and ensuring that software projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. They are responsible for planning, executing, and closing projects. This involves defining project scope, creating schedules, allocating resources, managing risks, and monitoring progress. The project manager is also responsible for communicating with stakeholders, including clients, management, and team members, to ensure everyone is on the same page (Project-Management.com, 2023)

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Without maintenance, any software will be obsolete and essentially useless over time. All software companies should have a specific strategy in place to tackle software maintenance in an effective and complete manner. Documentation is one important strategy in software development (Thales, 2024)

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical Issues in Software Development • 1. Unethical data collection • 2. Algorithmic bias • 3. Weak security • 4. Wrong Priorities. To adhere they should to these principles encompass responsibility, accountability, fairness, and justice. Responsibility and accountability in software engineering (Full Scale, 2024)
